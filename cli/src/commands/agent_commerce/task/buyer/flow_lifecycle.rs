     🛑🛑🛑 **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT -- in escrow mode you MUST push the review decision to the user via `pending-decisions-v2 request` (NOT a plain text reply, NOT `xmtp_dispatch_user`)**.\n\
     `xmtp_dispatch_user` is a pure notification: user replies cannot be relayed back to the sub session → the review flow deadlocks. The correct flow handles this via `pending-decisions-v2 request` → CLI playbook → `xmtp_prompt_user` (with llmContent + userContent) so the user session can relay the review decision back.\n\
     🔴 Real incident: a Minimax model received job_submitted, called xmtp_dispatch_user with \"the ASP has submitted; awaiting your review\" -- the user never saw the deliverable, could not relay a decision, and the task was stuck.\n\n\
     🛑🛑🛑 **Even if you already processed the ASP's a2a-agent-chat deliverable message earlier in this turn (e.g. called xmtp_file_download), upon receiving job_submitted you MUST still execute every Step below in full**.\n\
     Handling a2a-agent-chat (file download) != the review flow -- the review must be driven by the job_submitted playbook, and the deliverable content (file path / text) MUST be placed into the `--user-content` of `pending-decisions-v2 request` for the user to see.\n\n\
     🛑 **In escrow mode auto-approval is strictly forbidden**: you must wait for the user's relayed decision; the agent must not decide on behalf of the user, regardless of deliverable quality or how close to deadline.\n\
     ⚠️ In x402 mode: funds are already paid; just notify the user of the deliverable content; the user cannot reject.\n\n\
     [Your next actions (strict order)]\n\n\

     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent pending-decisions-v2 list --format json\n\
     ```\n\
     If `entries[]` already contains a sub_key with `job={job_id}` for this role → the user has already been notified; this is a duplicate event; **end the turn without re-notifying**. Otherwise → continue.\n\n\
     **Step 1 — Query task details; extract deliverable and payment mode:**\n\
     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent status {job_id}\n\
     ```\n\
     Extract `paymentMode` (int: 1=escrow, 3=x402). The status endpoint does not return deliverableUrl; extract that from the chat history in Step 2. Get qualityStandards from `onchainos agent common context` (the value at task creation time is authoritative).\n\n\
     **Step 2 — Fetch the deliverable content (distinguish text vs file):**\n\
     ⚠️ The deliverable content MUST be extracted in this step and placed into Step 3's userContent — the earlier ASP message only triggered a short notification and the user has not seen the deliverable body yet. **Do not omit, summarize, or just write \"already sent to you\".**\n\
     First call `session_status` to get the current sub session's sessionKey (reused later; do not call it again this turn).\n\
     Then call `xmtp_get_conversation_history` (sessionKey = the value obtained above) and do two things:\n\
     \x20\x20a) From `onchainos agent common context {job_id} --role buyer --agent-id {agent_id}` extract `qualityStandards` (the review standard as of task creation); if empty, skip that line.\n\
     \x20\x20b) Find the ASP message **carrying the `[intent:deliver]` suffix tag** (scan newest to oldest; first match is the deliverable), and branch on `deliverableType`:\n\n\
     --- Case A: deliverableType=file (message contains fileKey / digest / salt / nonce / secret decryption fields) ---\n\n\
     Call the xmtp_file_download tool:\n\

     \x20\x20- fileKey: fileKey returned by the ASP at upload\n\
     \x20\x20- agentId: {agent_id} (user agentId)\n\
     \x20\x20- digest: SHA-256 digest (hex)\n\
     \x20\x20- salt: encryption salt (base64)\n\
     \x20\x20- nonce: encryption nonce (base64)\n\
     \x20\x20- secret: encryption secret (base64)\n\
     \x20\x20- filename: (optional) save filename\n\
     ⚠️ Before calling, print: `[buyer-xmtp] xmtp_file_download: fileKey=<fileKey>, agentId={agent_id}`\n\
     ⚠️ After calling, print: `[buyer-xmtp] xmtp_file_download result: localPath=<returned local path>`\n\n\
     On success, record localPath; **it MUST be a full absolute path** (e.g. /Users/xxx/Downloads/task-staging.png).\n\
     ⚠️ **Never show only the filename** (e.g. cat-picture.png) -- the user cannot locate the file. Any later content shown to the user MUST include the full path.\n\
     If download fails → note in the display: \"file download failed, please ask the ASP to resend\".\n\
     ⚠️ If the ASP message contains text alongside the file (e.g. \"here is the deliverable, please check\"), capture it into deliverableText as well.\n\
     Deliverable display variables: deliverableType=file, localPath=<full path>, deliverableText=<note text, empty if none>\n\n\
     --- Case B: deliverableType=text (body content between `---` separators) ---\n\n\
     Extract the text between `---` separators in the `[intent:deliver]` message; **keep the original wording in full**, do not truncate or summarize.\n\
     Deliverable display variables: deliverableType=text, deliverableText=<full original text sent by the ASP>\n\n\
     **Step 3 — Branch by payment mode:**\n\n\
     --------- Branch A: escrow — enqueue review decision via `pending-decisions-v2 request` ---------\n\n\
     Build the `--user-content` from the deliverable variables above (split by deliverableType). Then run (substitute `<full sessionKey>` from the session_status call in Step 2):\n\
     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent pending-decisions-v2 request \\\n\
       --sub-key \"<full sessionKey from session_status>\" \\\n\
       --job-id {job_id} --role buyer --agent-id {agent_id} \\\n\
       --user-content \"<deliverable card + A/B options, see templates below>\" \\\n\
       --list-label \"[Decision {short_id}] Approve / Reject\"\n\
     ```\n\
     🌐 **Localize `--user-content` AND `--list-label` to the user's language** before running (canonical English samples below).\n\n\
     `--user-content` template (canonical English; localize before passing) — split by deliverableType:\n\n\
     ▸ deliverableType=file:\n\
     ```\n\
     [Job {short_id} — you are the User Agent] The ASP has submitted the deliverable (file); downloaded locally.\n\

     ```\n\n\
     Follow the playbook the CLI returns verbatim, then end the turn. Do NOT manually construct `llmContent` / call `xmtp_dispatch_session` yourself — that path is owned by `pending-decisions-v2` now.\n\n\
     ===============================================================\n\

     This playbook ends here for Step 3. In a later turn, upon receiving `[USER_DECISION_RELAY] decision: <user verbatim>` from the user-session, continue with Step 4 below.\n\n\
     **Step 4 — After receiving `[USER_DECISION_RELAY] decision: <user verbatim>` from the user-session**:\n\
     Inspect the verbatim text (case-insensitive; trim whitespace/punctuation) and route:\n\
     - Verbatim is `A` / `a` / `选A` / `1` / `Choose A` / `option A`, OR contains `通过` / `同意` / `满意` / `验收` / `接受` / `approve` / `accept` / `agree` → call `onchainos agent next-action --jobid {job_id} --jobStatus approve_review --role buyer --agentId {agent_id}` for the approve playbook (which will run `onchainos agent complete`).\n\
     - Verbatim is `B` / `b` / `选B` / `2` / `Choose B` / `option B`, OR contains `拒绝` / `不通过` / `不满意` / `不接受` / `reject` / `refuse` → call `onchainos agent next-action --jobid {job_id} --jobStatus reject_review --role buyer --agentId {agent_id}` (extract the reason from the verbatim after `理由` / `reason` / `因为`; if not stated, default to `did not meet acceptance criteria`).\n\
     - Otherwise (unrelated reply) → call `pending-decisions-v2 request` again with a clarifying userContent (\"您刚才回复 「<verbatim>」我没理解,请回复 「通过」 或 「拒绝, 理由: <...>」 或 直接回复 A / B\") to re-ask.\n\n\
     ===============================================================\n\
     🔴🔴🔴 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION when routing in Step 4:\n\
     ❌ Do NOT skip `next-action` and call `onchainos agent complete` / `onchainos agent reject` directly — the `job_submitted` playbook deliberately splits approve/reject into independent pseudo-events; without the playbook from next-action you will miss internal pre-complete / pre-refuse signature steps and funds will stay locked.\n\
     ❌ Do NOT call `xmtp_dispatch_session` yourself — you are the sub session (executor), NOT the user session (relay). The relay has already arrived; your job is to execute the playbook, not to re-dispatch.\n\
     🔴 Real incident: a model received the user's approval, skipped next-action and called `onchainos agent complete` directly — the on-chain complete was misformed, funds remained locked, and the user was told the job was approved when it was not.\n\
     ===============================================================\n\n\
     --------- Branch B: x402 — notify the user (no rejection allowed) ---------\n\n\

     {terminal_session_hint}\n\
     ⚠️ **Do not auto-rate** — at the end of the notification, prompt the user: if they want to rate the ASP (0–5 stars), they can reply with their rating.\n\
     When the user replies with a rating intent, ask for a score (0–5 integer) and optional text feedback if not already provided, then execute:\n\
     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent feedback-submit --agent-id <providerAgentId> --creator-id {agent_id} --score <0-5> --task-id {job_id} [--description \"<optional text>\"]\n\
     ```\n\
     ⚠️ `--score` MUST come from the user's explicit reply in this rating flow; do NOT infer from verbs like `rate` / `打分`, do NOT use a default value.\n\
     ⚠️ `--agent-id` is the ASP being rated (providerAgentId from Step 1 context); `--creator-id` is the buyer's own agent id ({agent_id}).\n\

     - Text summary → the text portion the user wrote\n\
     - Image path (if the user provided a local file path) → `--image` parameter\n\
     **At least one** of text and image is required.\n\n\
     **Step 2 -- Pull the negotiation / delivery chat history of this sub session and prepend it to the text as objective evidence:**\n\
     Call `xmtp_get_conversation_history` (sessionKey = this sub session's sessionKey) to get the full a2a-agent-chat history with the ASP.\n\
     Stitch the history as a **structured section** at the top of the `--text` field (the arbiter is an LLM and reads through the text field), then append the user summary below:\n\n\
     ```\n\
     ==== Negotiation / delivery chat history (from xmtp_get_conversation_history) ====\n\
     [time] ASP(<agentId>): ...\n\
     [time] User(<agentId>): ...\n\
     ... (chronological; key checkpoints: quote / [intent:propose] / [intent:ack] / [intent:confirm] / deliverable message)\n\n\
     ==== User evidence summary ====\n\
     <verbatim user summary>\n\
     ```\n\n\
     ⚠️ **`--text` is capped at 16 KB** -- if the chat history is long, **keep only** the key checkpoints (PROPOSE / ACK / CONFIRM / deliverable / both sides' key dispute points) and prepend \"(key checkpoints extracted)\"; do not blindly drop the first N entries.\n\n\
     **Step 3 -- Call the CLI to upload evidence (off-chain multipart):**\n\
     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent dispute upload {job_id} --agent-id {agent_id} --text \"<chat history + user summary, concatenated>\" --image <user image path or omit>\n\
     ```\n\
     At least one of text and image is required; to omit an image, drop the entire `--image` segment -- do not pass an empty string.\n\n\
     ⚠️ **Do not xmtp_send any message to the ASP** (e.g. \"evidence submitted\"); the ASP learns via on-chain events.\n\n\

     You should not run a playbook with `wakeup_notify` as --jobStatus -- this playbook is only a guide.\n\n\
     [Your next actions (strict order)]\n\n\
     **Step 1 -- Read the real status from the envelope**:\n\
     From the wakeup_notify envelope that triggered this turn, read `message.jobStatus` (e.g. `accepted` / `submitted` / `refused` / `disputed` / `completed` / `rejected` and other real status strings).\n\n\

     onchainos agent next-action --jobid {job_id} --jobStatus <value of message.jobStatus> --role buyer --agentId {agent_id}\n\
     ```\n\
     Follow the returned playbook for what to do at the current status.\n\n\
     **Step 3 -- Idempotency self-check (avoid re-prompting the user)**:\n\
     If the playbook from Step 2 would push a decision to the user — i.e. it contains `onchainos agent pending-decisions-v2 request` — **first** call:\n\
     ```bash\n\
     onchainos agent pending-decisions-v2 list --format json\n\
     ```\n\
     - The returned `entries` already contains a sub_key with `job={job_id}` for this role (the prompt was queued before disconnection) → **skip the script's push step**; instead call `xmtp_dispatch_user` content=`{wakeup_resume}` and end the turn.\n\
     - No matching entry → run the Step 2 playbook normally; the `pending-decisions-v2 request` call handles the prompt.\n\n\

🛑 **No skipping**: you MUST finish collecting all fields → show the confirmation form → wait for an explicit user confirmation before calling the CLI.

================================================
Step 1 -- Field collection (collect progressively in conversation; **only enter Step 2 when all fields are ready**)
================================================

| Field | CLI flag | Constraint | How to collect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Description | --description | 10-2000 chars | Consolidate the user's words. If <10 → \"A more detailed description helps match a better Provider. Could you add more specifics?\" |
| Title | --title | <=30 chars | Agent-generated; **must count chars after generating**, shorten if >30 |
| Summary | --description-summary | <=200 chars | Agent-generated; **must count chars after generating**, shorten if >200 |
| Payment token | --currency | Only USDT / USDG | ⚠️ See token rules below |
| Budget | --budget | number; <=5 decimal places; max 10,000,000 | Extract the number |
| Max budget | --max-budget | **Required**; >= budget; <=5 decimal places; max 10,000,000 | ⚠️ **You MUST ask the user explicitly**, do not auto-fill or guess. This is the negotiation price cap; the ASP's quote cannot exceed it |
| Open deadline | --deadline-open | 10 min - 6 months; format `<n>h` / `<n>m` | **MUST ask the user**. How long the task stays open before auto-closing if no ASP accepts |
| Submit deadline | --deadline-submit | 1 min - 6 months; format `<n>h` / `<n>m` | **MUST ask the user**. How long after acceptance the ASP must deliver |
| Designated provider | --provider | optional; provider agentId | If the user names a specific provider, extract the agentId. **Do not ask proactively** -- if the user does not bring it up, omit it |

🛑 **Token rules (top priority)**:
- User writes \"USDT\" or \"USDG\" explicitly → use it directly, no confirmation
- User uses fuzzy expressions (\"U\" / \"u\" / \"buck\" / \"dollar\" / \"USD\" / \"100U\" / \"50u\") → **you MUST first ask \"Please confirm the payment token: USDT or USDG?\"**, fill it in only after the user replies explicitly
- **Do not default to USDT**: rendering \"100 USDT\" when the user only said \"100U\" is a violation

================================================
Step 2 -- Validation (after all fields collected, before showing the form)
================================================

1. Token is neither USDT nor USDG → \"Only USDT and USDG are supported. Please choose one.\"
2. **Currency consistency between budget and max budget**: if the user mentions different tokens for budget and max budget (e.g. \"budget 10 USDT, max 20 USDG\") → **block**, \"Budget and max budget must use the same token. Please confirm: USDT or USDG?\". The task has a single --currency, the two must match.
3. Description < 10 chars → ask the user to expand
4. max_budget < budget → \"Max budget cannot be less than the budget.\"
5. max_budget missing → \"Please set the max budget (the negotiation price cap); the ASP's quote cannot exceed it.\"
6. budget > 10,000,000 or > 5 decimal places → tell the user the limits

================================================
Step 3 -- Identity & balance check
================================================

1. `onchainos agent get` to check whether the current account has buyer identity (role=1)
2. Has buyer → tell the user which account is being used
3. No buyer → guide registration via `onchainos agent register`
4. Insufficient balance → warn but do not block creation

================================================
Step 4 -- 🛑 Communication availability check (must not be skipped)
================================================

🛑 **MANDATORY -- complete this before showing the confirmation form**.
All post-creation negotiation, notifications, and review depend on the messaging service; messaging down = task created and immediately stuck.

1. **Read** the **entire content** of `skills/okx-agent-chat/after-agent-list-changed.md`
2. **Fully execute** the flow inside after-agent-list-changed.md (start from Step 0; walk the decision tree to completion)
3. After it finishes, proceed to Step 5

================================================
Step 5 -- Show the confirmation form (format per `skills/okx-agent-task/references/display-formats.md` Section 3)
================================================

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | <agent summary> |
| Summary | <agent summary, <=200 chars> |
| Description | <full content> (if <=200 chars, put it in the table; if >200, write `see below` in the table and render the full content as prose below) |
| Payment token | <USDT or USDG> |
| Budget | <number> |
| Max budget | <number> (negotiation price cap) |
| Open deadline | <Nh> (auto-closes after N hours if no ASP accepts) |
| Submit deadline | <Nh> (deliverable must be submitted within N hours of acceptance) |
| Designated provider | <agentId> (🛑 only show this row if the user explicitly designated one; **otherwise omit the entire row** -- do not write \"none\" or \"none (public task)\" or any placeholder. Tasks default to private; \"no designated provider\" != \"public task\") |

> Confirm? Once you confirm, I will submit the task on-chain immediately.

⚠️ Use Chinese field labels for Chinese conversations, English labels for English conversations.

→ **End this turn**; after showing the form you MUST stop and wait for the user's explicit confirmation of **this form**.
🛑 The user's earlier confirmation on a sub-question (e.g. token confirmation) does NOT count as confirming the form; you must wait for a new reply after the form is shown.

================================================
Step 6 -- After user confirms the form, call the CLI (🛑 must NOT be in the same turn as Step 5)
================================================

```bash
onchainos agent create-task \\
  --description \"<description>\" \\
  --description-summary \"<summary>\" \\
  --title \"<title>\" \\
  --budget <budget> --max-budget <max_budget> \\
  --currency <USDT|USDG> \\
  --deadline-open <deadline_open> --deadline-submit <deadline_submit> \\
  [--provider <provider agentId>]
```

⚠️ `--provider` (optional): designate a provider agentId. With it set, job_created skips recommend and routes directly via the provider's service-list by payment mode (x402 or A2A negotiation). Pass it only when the user explicitly designates a provider.

🚫 **create-task only accepts the flags above. There is no --content / --period / --visibility / --amount / --token / --payment-mode flag.** When `--provider` is passed, the CLI automatically sets visibility=1 (PRIVATE) and providerAgentId; no extra flags needed.
⚠️ **Payment mode is not set at creation** -- paymentMode is decided downstream: the A2A negotiation path is always escrow; if a provider is designated and has an endpoint, x402 is used. If the user mentions a preferred payment mode at publication, **do not pass --payment-mode**; tell them: \"The payment mode will be determined automatically when negotiating with the provider.\"

After success, call `xmtp_dispatch_user` to notify the user:
- No --provider → content: \"Task submitted; jobId: <jobId>; awaiting on-chain confirmation (~seconds). Once confirmed, the system will automatically fetch the recommended provider list for you to choose from.\"
- With --provider → content: \"Task submitted; jobId: <jobId>; designated provider: <providerName> (agentId: <agentId>); awaiting on-chain confirmation (~seconds). Once confirmed, the system will automatically connect with the designated provider.\"

===============================================================
🛑🛑🛑 STOP -- after create-task you **MUST end this turn immediately**
===============================================================
❌ **Do not say \"task published\" or \"publish succeeded\"** -- create-task only submits the transaction; it is not yet confirmed on-chain.
❌ **Do not call `recommend`** -- the recommended provider list is auto-triggered by the backup session upon receiving the `job_created` system notification; it is not part of this turn.
❌ **Do not call any onchainos agent commands** -- this turn ends here; all further actions are driven by on-chain events.
❌ **Do not describe the subsequent flow** (negotiation / bargaining / direct payment / x402) in the notification — at this point the payment path (escrow negotiation vs x402 direct payment) has NOT been determined yet (it depends on the provider's service-list, which is queried in the `job_created` event handler, not here). Saying \"I'll negotiate for you\" or \"the price will be X\" is potentially inaccurate and misleading.
