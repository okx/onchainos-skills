# Invariants — rendering rules, id ladder, fields, commands

Load this file when: rendering a card / diff / detail view, resolving `#<id>`, translating CLI labels, or handling `--service` fields.

---

## Lexicon (prose / Q&A / post-success rows when CLI label is absent)

- **Roles:** requester → **User Agent** / 用户 · provider → **Agent Service Provider (ASP)** / 服务提供商 · evaluator → **Evaluator Agent** / 仲裁者. Never raw enum, never legacy nouns (buyer/seller), never bilingual parenthetical.
- **Service type:** A2MCP → **API service** · A2A → **agent to agent**. Gloss once per table: "API service = pay-per-call, fixed price; agent to agent = negotiated / off-chain pricing." Never raw A2MCP/A2A.
- **Stars:** render `★ <value>` from CLI's `ratingStars` / `feedbackRate` / `average` **directly** — never divide by 20, never show raw 0–100. Null/0 context-split: **search** rows → `null`=`—`, `0`=`No rating yet`; **list / detail / feedback** → no rating = `No rating yet` (never `—`).
- **Fee:** stored/sent as a plain numeric string (`"10"`); **displayed** as `N USDT` (USDT is implicit — the renderer appends it); A2A empty or zero → `negotiable`. **Address:** lowercase `0x…1234`. **Reviewer** slot = "reviewer", never "creator".

## Card skeleton (every confirmation / diff / detail card uses THIS)

Two-column pipe table `| Field | Value |`, one row per field. Role row uses localized label (never enum); photo row = uploaded CDN URL or `default` (providers require a URL; `default` only for requester/evaluator — see register §5) — never a user-pasted link (rejected).

- **Confirmation variant** (create only): ends with `> Reply **1** to confirm and run.` (localized). No bash shown.
- **Diff variant** (update only): 3 columns `| Field | Current | New |`; unchanged fields → `(unchanged)`; changed New cell **bold**. Show real before→after values.

## Verbatim-render contract (P0-4)

When CLI returns `card[]` / `cells[]` plus `roleLabel` / `statusLabel` / `approvalLabel` / `ratingStars`, render numeric/star fields **verbatim** — do not hand-map integers, do not divide score/20, never show raw 0–100. **Verbatim applies to numbers/stars/ids/addresses only — NOT to language.** Every string `*Label` field and all surrounding prose/labels are English-canonical and MUST be translated into the SKILL §Language-Lock language before rendering. Fallback: hand-map via Lexicon if `*Label` absent (legacy response).

## CLI output fields — translate before rendering

- `roleLabel` / `statusLabel` / `approvalLabel`
- Service type values: "API service" / "agent to agent"
- Placeholder strings: "(not set)" / "default" / "No rating yet" / "(no comment)" / "free" / "negotiable"
- `findings[].issue` and `findings[].fix` — translate the QA guidance text

## #id ladder (P0-3) — resolving `#<id>` after create

1. top-level **`newAgentId`** when its value is a **non-empty string** (PRIMARY — WS push succeeded)
2. else `agent.agentId` from the WS push object
3. `newAgentId` is `null` (WS push timed out) — omit `#<id>` substring, use fallback wording.

Never invent or borrow a pre-check id; never emit a bare `# `.
**Non-create intents** (activate/deactivate/update/detail): no `newAgentId` — use the `#N` the user typed or the CLI's direct id.

## Fields-from-user (output-safety invariant)

`name` / `description` / `picture` / `service.*` come from the user's **literal reply this turn** — never pre-filled from userEmail, wallet name, or session metadata. Carve-out: you MAY reformat the user's OWN words into the **2-part service description** (① core-capability summary ② what the user must provide) on separate lines (illustrate, never invent a capability or metric).

**Name must be a brand, not a person (semantic QA — register §4):** block any agent name that **contains** a celebrity / public-figure name as a substring, even when prefixed or suffixed (e.g. Trump, Musk, CZ, 马斯克, 马云). This is a semantic check, not a CLI mechanical rule.

**Confirmation requirement for any reformat/draft (non-overridable):** reformatting or drafting is a *draft*, never an authorization to commit silently. Whenever you reshape the user's words into the 2-part description, you MUST (1) flag every affected row on the confirmation card / diff card with an explicit marker — e.g. ` ✏️ drafted from your words — please review` — so the user can tell Claude-rewritten content from their own verbatim input, and (2) wait for the normal card confirm (Reply **1**) before the write. Never let reformatted/drafted content reach the chain presented as the user's literal input. If the user flags any drafted row as wrong, re-collect that field from their own words and redraw — do not argue or keep your draft.

## Commands (10 `onchainos agent` subcommands — you invoke them, never show them)

`create · pre-check · update · get · activate · deactivate · upload · search · service-list · feedback-submit · feedback-list`.

- `pre-check` (`--role` required / `--consent-key` optional): folds consent + uniqueness, see §Gates / register §2. Auto/internal — never shown; outputs (`canCreate` etc.) rendered inline.
- `validate-listing` (QA — register §4, called internally by activate): auto/internal.
- `activate` subsumes submit-approval (approvalStatus ∈ {1,5} — handled internally by CLI).
- `consent` has no public subcommand — driven by `pre-check`.
- Never suggest `xmtp-sign`; no `--address` (signs with current wallet).

Array fields: create/update/get/search → `list`; feedback-list → `items` or `list` (backend inconsistent; CLI normalizes both); service-list → nested `services`.

## Input contract — `--service` JSON + flag gotchas (single source of truth)

`create` / `update` / `validate-listing` all parse `--service` into the **same** element shape, so the keys below are identical across the three. **Wrong keys silently break the call** → `validate-listing` returns a `service`/`PARSE` finding; `create`/`update` return `missing required field in --service: <field>` → a retry. Use these keys **exactly** — camelCase, matching the on-chain service schema (no lowercase, no underscores):

| key | required | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `serviceName` | ✅ | service name (5–30) |
| `serviceDescription` | ✅ | 2-part description on separate lines: ① core-capability summary (≤200 CJK chars) · ② what the user must provide (≤200 CJK chars). Total ≤400 CJK chars; no example prompts / links / tech-stack / disclaimers. Length is counted in **East-Asian display width** (CJK = 2, ASCII = 1) — matches the backend |
| `serviceType` | ✅ | raw enum `A2MCP` (API service) or `A2A` (agent to agent) — never the localized label |
| `fee` | A2MCP ✅ / A2A optional | a **plain number as a JSON string**, e.g. `"10"` (quoted — never a bare number `10`). USDT is the implicit, only currency; **no currency suffix/symbol**, ≤6 dp. `"10 USDT"` / `"5元"` → rejected (P1) |
| `endpoint` | A2MCP only | `https://…`; **omit entirely for A2A** |
| `operation` | **`update` flow only** | one of `create` / `update` / `delete` — the per-service delta directive (see update.md §6). **Omit entirely on `create` / register** (services there are all new). |
| `id` | optional | the existing service's id (from `agent service-list`) — used to target an existing service in the `update` flow. |

Example (register / `create` — no `id`, no `operation`): `--service '[{"serviceName":"…","serviceDescription":"…","serviceType":"A2MCP","fee":"10","endpoint":"https://…"}]'`
Example (`update` delta — modify one service): `--service '[{"operation":"update","id":"<existing-id>","serviceName":"…","serviceDescription":"…","serviceType":"A2MCP","fee":"10","endpoint":"https://…"}]'`

**Agent-level vs service-level description (most common mix-up):** the *agent* description is the top-level `--description` flag; each *service* description is the `serviceDescription` key **inside** the `--service` JSON. Different field, different place.

**Flag gotchas (case/shape-sensitive — getting these wrong forces a retry):**
- `update` → `--agent-id` (singular); `get` → `--agent-ids` (plural). Don't swap them.
- `activate` → `--preferred-language` is **required** (BCP-47, e.g. `zh-CN` / `en-US`); omit it → `missing required parameter`.
- create role flag is `--role`; `update` has no `--role` (role is fixed at create).
