# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Dev Environment

- **Dev binary**: `cli/target/release/onchainos`. If it does not exist, build it first: `cd cli && cargo build --release`.
- **`ONCHAINOS_HOME`**: Points to project-local `.onchainos/` for wallet credentials.
- **Show executed command**: after every `onchainos` command, print the actual command that was executed.
- **NEVER skip CLI calls**: always execute the onchainos CLI command to get real-time data. Do NOT answer from skill files or your own knowledge.

## Project Overview

This is a **Claude Code plugin** — a collection of onchainos skills for on-chain operations. The project provides skills for token search, market data, wallet balance queries, swap execution, DeFi investment management, and transaction broadcasting across 20+ blockchains. The `onchainos` CLI also works as a native MCP server.

## Architecture

- **skills/** — 19 onchainos CLI skill definitions (each is a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter + CLI command reference)
- **workflows/** — Pre-built multi-step workflow docs (`INDEX.md` for routing, `TEMPLATE.md` for authoring guide)
- **cli/** — Rust CLI binary (`onchainos`), built with `clap`; source in `cli/src/`, config in `cli/Cargo.toml`
- **cli/src/mcp/mod.rs** — MCP server implementation (rmcp v1.1.1)
- **.mcp.json.example** — MCP server configuration template for Claude Code
- **.github/workflows/** — CI/CD pipeline (`release.yml`: tag-triggered build for 9 platforms → GitHub Release)
- **install.sh** — One-line installer for macOS / Linux (`curl | sh`)

## Clippy

CI uses `-D warnings` (warnings as errors). Run `cargo clippy` before pushing. Common issues:

- `ptr_arg`: use `&[T]` / `&mut [T]` instead of `&Vec<T>` / `&mut Vec<T>` when the function doesn't need Vec-specific methods
- `too_many_arguments`: add `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` or refactor into a params struct
- `needless_borrow`: don't `&` a value that's already a reference
